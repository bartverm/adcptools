ADCPtools is a set of functions to process ADCP data. The current functions are developed for RDI data formats.

Some of the concepts used in these functions are explained in more detail in the following publication:

Vermeulen, B., Sassi, M.G. and Hoitink, A.J.F
_Improved flow velocity estimates from moving-boat ADCP measurements_
Water Resources Research [http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2013WR015152 doi:10.1002/2013WR015152]

Please refer to this work when using the functions from adcptools.
