	Repeat transect can be processed with the function \verb#procTrans.m#. This functions accepts two inputs:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item An ADCP structure \verb#adcp# read with \verb#readDeployment.m#.
		\item A transect ID matrix \verb#tid#. 
	\end{itemize}
	\verb#tid# is a matrix of integral numbers with as many columns as ensembles in \verb#adcp# and as many rows as cross-sections you want to process. Any non-zero number at \verb#(i,j)# indicates that the \verb#j#-th ensemble is part of the \verb#i#-th cross-section. The number itself indicates grouping of the ensembles withing a cross-section. If, for example, in one row we have numbers from \verb#1# to \verb#3#, this indicates that all ensembles with number \verb#1# belong together, like all with number \verb#2#, etc. This allows to group subsets of the data within one cross-section (\autoref{fig:tid})
